# About
The one and only boomer/zoomer communication bot. Also known as BOOMER BOT!

# Configuration
There needs to be an .env file in the root of the directory that has defined your OAuth twitch token, which should look like:

```
TWITCH_OAUTH_TOKEN='oauth:12345abcdefgtopsecret'
```

This file is gitignored by default.

Get your twitch oauth token from the following website (not managed by me):
